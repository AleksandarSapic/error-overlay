This Emacs extension provides a simple way to display and highlight errors in your code files. It scans for error patterns (such as syntax errors, warnings, or runtime exceptions) and highlights them directly in your buffer for easy identification.

## Features
- Highlight lines containing diagnostics
- Append diagnostic as text to the end of the line
- As you edit, errors are highlighted in real-time
